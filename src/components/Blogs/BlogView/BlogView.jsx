Her mother, Cessie, brewed her a mug of herbal tea, added a slug of whisky, and countered it with a tale of her own. At just 12, Cessie had been raped by her riding instructor. The Horseman, she called him. Having groomed her for assault, he then persuaded her that she was in love with him.

An account of McLaren’s efforts to win her mother’s blessing for the book over a girls’ weekend in New York frames a narrative composed of chronologically arranged vignettes that capture telling moments from McLaren’s girlhood and early adulthood. More room mate than parent, Cessie gave her the freedom to cruise through school snacking on magic mushrooms, stay out all night with calling home, and tolerate the gaze of a voyeur in the alleyway outside their apartment – until she woke to find him trying to climb through her bedroom window. Listening, McLaren’s first response was relief & perhaps her own story wasn’t so momentous after all.
